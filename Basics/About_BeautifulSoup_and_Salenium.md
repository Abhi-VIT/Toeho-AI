## About BeautifulSoup and Salenium

# BeautifulSoup
* BeautifulSoup is a Python library designed for quick and easy data extraction from XML and HTML files, ideal for static scraping.* 
* It works by creating a parse tree from page source code that allows for easy navigation and searching of the data structure.*

# Selenium
* Selenium is a browser automation tool that allows you to control a web browser programmatically, enabling interaction with dynamic content.*
* It can simulate user actions like clicking buttons, entering text, and scrolling, making it perfect for testing or scraping JavaScript-heavy sites.*

Together, they form a powerful combination: Selenium handles the dynamic interaction to load content, while BeautifulSoup parses the resulting HTML for data.
