They have eroded the vital boundary between professional life and personal well-being, turning evenings, weekends, and even holidays, into extensions of the workday. This culture of constant availability is not a badge of dedication; it is a creeping sickness, and its diagnosis is writ large across the face of the Indian workforce. The time has come for India to officially legislate a fundamental right for its citizens: the right to disconnect.As the proposer of a Private Member’s Bill advocating this very measure, I believe that this is not merely a piece of progressive labour reform. It is a national imperative for public health, long-term economic productivity, and social stability. We cannot achieve our aspirations as a global power if our most valuable resource — our people — are quietly burning out.An unsustainable pace of work in IndiaThe data paint a grim picture. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), a staggering 51% of India’s workforce works more than 49 hours per week, placing the country second globally for extended working hours. This is an unsustainable pace. The human cost of this relentless cycle is even more alarming: 78% of employees in India report experiencing job burnout, leading inevitably to physical and emotional exhaustion.AdvertisementPowered by:00:0000:00Ad will close in:3 seconds orclick to closeThis crisis of perpetual availability is not a matter of feeling fatigued; it translates directly into severe health conditions. The lack of a proper work-life balance contributes significantly to lifestyle diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, anxiety and depression. These are not just individual tragedies; they are a societal burden that drains our health-care system and severely impairs organisational productivity. A fatigued worker is less creative, more prone to error, and, ultimately, less productive. The current emphasis on measuring work by sheer duration over quality is archaic and self-defeating. The tragic death of Anna Sebastian Perayil (the healthy young E&Y employee who literally died of overwork in 2024) was a warning for the entire workforce. Furthermore, work-related stress, often fuelled by the expectation of 24X7 digital availability, is a significant contributor to the burgeoning national mental health crisis, accounting for 10%-12% of cases, as per the National Mental Health Survey. To ignore this silent epidemic is to wilfully neglect the well-being of the nation.India’s current legal framework, despite recent attempts, remains insufficient to protect the average worker in the hyper-connected, modern economy. The Occupational Safety, Health, and Working Conditions Code, 2020, sets a maximum limit on working hours for traditional “workers”, but critically, it often fails to extend the same protection to all “employees”, particularly contractual, freelance, and gig workers. This gap leaves a large portion of India’s young, digitally-native, and highly vulnerable workforce exposed to exploitative working hours, without adequate safeguards. In a system where employees fear disciplinary action or termination simply for failing to answer a late night email, the power dynamic is inherently skewed towards the employer.A global issueMy proposed Bill aims to correct this foundational flaw. It is crucial that the Code is amended to clearly define and limit working hours for all employees. It seeks to enshrine the “right to disconnect” in law, ensuring two core protections: first, employees cannot be penalised, disciplined, or discriminated against for refusing to respond to work-related communication beyond their specified working hours. Second, a mechanism must be established to address and resolve grievances when the rights of workers are infringed upon. Both are fundamentally about restoring dignity and ensuring that the right to recharge is respected, allowing individuals to maintain their physical and mental well-being without fear of professional repercussions.India is not alone in grappling with the challenges of the ‘always-on’ economy. This is a global issue demanding a legislative response. Countries across the world have already recognised this necessity, setting a clear precedent that we must now follow. France, a pioneer in this area, introduced the “right to disconnect” as far back as 2017. Since then, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, and Australia have followed suit, embedding similar protections into their labour codes.These laws mandate that companies negotiate specific protocols to limit after-hours digital communication. This is a clear signal that the most developed economies understand that respecting downtime is not an impediment to economic growth, but a precondition for sustainable growth. We must shed the myth that the world will stop turning if an email is answered the next morning.The law, however, is merely a framework. The “right to disconnect” is defined as the employee being no longer compelled to remain available beyond their regular working hours, thereby blurring the lines between their personal and professional lives and exacerbating stress and burnout. The legislation provides the shield, but we must also wield the sword of cultural change.The legislative momentum behind the right to disconnect confirms its urgency, with pioneering States such as Kerala already introducing their own legislation for the local private sector. While these State-level initiatives are commendable steps, the complexity and national scale of the ‘always-on’ crisis demand a uniform, central amendment to secure this protection for every Indian worker. My proposed Bill, by amending the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code (2020), ensures that this right is foundational across all States and, critically, extends protection to the vulnerable contractual and gig workforce often left out by current definitions. This national approach embeds the right to disconnect as an essential pillar of occupational safety, including mandated mental health support, transforming it from a simple prohibition on employer action into a holistic mandate for employee well-being.Other interconnected steps to takeStill, laws alone are insufficient to facilitate meaningful transformation. For any legislation to be effective, it must be supported by comprehensive awareness programmes, advocacy and sensitisation workshops for both employees and management. It is especially important to address the organisational norms that perpetuate toxic work cultures — those where “presenteeism” is valued over actual output, and where the late night email is seen as a proxy for commitment. The provisions for proactive mental health support services, including counselling and psychological support for workers, must, therefore, become integral to the new workplace ethos.The right to disconnect is an investment. It is an acknowledgment that well-rested minds are sharper, more innovative and more committed in the long run. By allowing employees to genuinely recharge and recover, we are not simply reducing working hours. We are dramatically enhancing the quality of those hours spent on the job.Incorporating legal protections for a work-life balance — the right to disconnect and limiting working hours — will forge a holistic and vigorous approach toward improving the workplace environment in India. By focusing on the well-being of our employees, both their physical and mental health will improve, creating a more sustainable and, ultimately, more productive workforce for the future of India.The choice before us is clear: to continue down the path of burnout, risking the health and potential of our young demographic dividend, or to embrace this reform, liberating our workforce and proving that India’s economy is built not just on speed, but on the strength and sustainability of its people. I urge the government to implement this necessary step towards a healthier, happier, and more productive nation.Shashi Tharoor is the fourth-term Member of Parliament (Congress) for Thiruvananthapuram (Lok Sabha), an award-winning author, a former Minister of State for Human Rights Resources Development and a former Chairman of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Information TechnologyPublished- January 07, 2026 12:16 am ISTRead  Comments0/0NewCopy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditREAD LATERSEE ALLRemovePRINTRelated Topicsonline/PDAs and smartphones/IT/computer sciences/email/social issue/employment/laws/labour/employer/employee/India/human rights/health/economy (general)/Hypertension/diabetes/mental health/France/Portugal",0.09606644365735274,Positive
https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/nitrogen-vacancy-centres-diamond-quantum-spins-superradiant-maser/article70472909.ece,The perfect flaw: how a diamond defect is changing quantum physicsPremium,General,2026-01-07,"Imagine a diamond.You probably thought of a clear and flawless gemstone used in jewellery. But to a physicist, a perfect diamond might actually be quite boring. Something magical happens when the diamond isjust a little broken.For decades, scientists have been fascinated by a specific type of defect in the diamond crystal lattice called the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre. All diamonds are made of a rigid grid of carbon atoms. An NV centre occurs when one carbon atom is replaced by a nitrogen atom, and the spot next to it is left empty.AdvertisementPowered by:00:0000:00Ad will close in:3 seconds orclick to closeThis seeming blemish turns the diamond into a powerhouse for quantum technologies.If diamonds and pencils are made out of carbon, how is it that pencils can write?Magnetic arrowsThe NV centre is often called a ‘perfect defect’ because it behaves like a single atom trapped in a solid cage. This structure gives it some remarkable abilities that hold great potential to transform how we think about computers and sensors.The NV centre has a property called spin. Think of it as a small magnetic arrow. Because the NV centre is trapped inside the diamond structure, it’s shielded from much of the noise that would otherwise scramble its spin. This helps the spin stay coherent, or quantummy, for longer.This is useful because scientists can then measure how the spin’s internal energy levels respond to the environment, including very weak magnetic or electric fields.This is why NV centres are some of the world’s smallest and most precise sensors. And scientists have been using them to map the magnetic fields associated with brain activity and to detect microscopic cracks in metals.Most quantum experiments require large, heavy, and expensive refrigerators to cool atoms down to near absolute zero (-273 ºC). If an environment becomes too warm, the quantum effects disappear in a chaotic mess because they’re sensitive to stray amounts of energy.But NV centres are special because their rigid diamond cage protects them. They can hold onto their quantum state even at room temperature. This makes them much more practical for real-world devices, like portable medical scanners and navigation systems that don’t need GPS.Trillions of centresOne of the most useful traits of the NV centre is the way it interacts with light.If you shine a green laser on it, the centre will glow red. The brightness of the red glow will change depending on the state of its spin. This allows scientists to ‘read’ the quantum information stored in the diamond just by looking at how much light it emits. It’s a bridge between the invisible world of quantum mechanics and the visible world we live in.Textbook update due? Altermagnetism emerges as a new class of magnetic orderWhile NV centres are amazing on their own, matters become complicated when you pack millions of them together. Usually, when these quantum spins are too close to one another, they start interacting in messy ways. They push and pull on each other, creating noise that destroys the quantum signal. This is generally seen as a problem to be fixed.However, a study published inNature Physicson January 2 has turned this problem on its head. A team of researchers from Austria and Japan has reported a way to use these messy interactions to create a powerful and continuous beam of microwave light.A diamond maserThe researchers took a diamond packed with about 9 trillion NV centres and placed it inside a superconducting microwave cavity — a device that traps microwaves so they can bounce back and forth and build up, like sound echoing in a room.Then they used a microwave pulse to energise, or invert, the spins of the NV centres. In a standard experiment, the NV centers would release this energy as a quick, bright burst of microwave light called superradiance and then stop.After the initial burst, however, the system didn’t stop in the experiment. Instead, it started pulsing again, eventually settling into a continuous, steady emission of microwave light for up to one millisecond. In the world of quantum physics, a millisecond is a very long time.The team had effectively created a maser. You’ve probably heard of a laser, an acronym for ‘light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation’. A maser is the same thing but for microwave radiation instead of visible light.Diamonds pose a quantum block to India’s research ambitionBucket brigadeThe researchers discovered that the very thing usually considered a nuisance, the interaction between the spins, was actually powering this maser.“This discovery changes how we think about the quantum world,” Okinawa Institute’s director of the Center for Quantum Technologies and study coauthor Kae Nemoto said in a statement. “We’ve shown that the very interactions once thought to disrupt quantum behavior can instead be harnessed to create it. That shift opens entirely new directions for quantum technologies.”When the first group of NV centers released their energy into the cavity, they became de-excited, or tired. Usually, that would be the end of the show. But because the diamond was so dense, these tired spins were surrounded by other energetic spins that weren’t quite tuned to the cavity’s frequency.Through magnetic dipole-dipole interactions, essentially magnets pushing on magnets, the energetic spins passed their energy to the tired spins. This process re-filled the energy hole left behind by the first burst.It was like the bucket brigade firefighting technique, where neighbouring spins handed off their energy to the spins that could release it as light.Quantum diamond microscope to image magnetic fieldsPotential benefitsThe finding could lead to the development of highly stable superradiant masers with a very narrow linewidth, meaning the frequency of the light is extremely pure.“The principles we observe here could also enhance quantum sensors capable of detecting minute changes in magnetic or electric fields,” Jörg Schmiedmayer of the Vienna Center for Quantum Science and Technology, TU Wien, and study coauthor said in the release.“Such advances could benefit medical imaging, materials science, and environmental monitoring.”mukunth.v@thehindu.co.inPublished- January 07, 2026 09:00 am ISTRead  Comments0Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditREAD LATERSEE ALLRemovePRINTRelated Topicsphysics",0.115856185150828,Positive
https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/cricket-is-collateral-damage-in-a-game-of-political-expediency/article70477819.ece,BCCI vs BCB: Cricket is collateral damage in a game of political expediencyPremium,General,2026-01-06,"For so long has the Board of Control for Cricket in India been the bully of international cricket, it shouldn’t be a surprise that it is equally the bully of domestic cricket too. By asking the Kolkata Knight Riders to sack Bangladesh’s Mustafizur Rahman after he had been picked for the IPL, the BCCI showed it was more concerned with pleasing its masters in the government than the sport it was elected to protect and preserve.Seven players from Bangladesh were in the auction, one was picked. Then came the troll. It was a delicious opportunity for a politician to strike at Bangladesh (ahead of the elections in Bengal) and a prominent Muslim at home in the same action. He was like a batter who edges for runs and then sees an overthrow add another four to his score.Mustafizur Rahman unlikely to get any compensation after KKR releases himShah Rukh Khan is the face of KKR, so by the logic of the troll he becomes a traitor for choosing a player from Bangladesh, a troubled country where a Hindu man was killed in ongoing violence.AdvertisementPowered by:00:0000:00Ad will close in:3 seconds orclick to closeHow Bangladesh treat their minorities seems to have come as a shock to the politician who knows all about treating minorities at home.Bangladesh in response have asked the International Cricket Council to move their matches in next month’s T20 World Cup away from India while deciding the IPL will not be telecast in their country. Mustafizur, Shah Rukh Khan, private franchises, the game of cricket itself have become collateral damage in a game of political expediency.Don't feel secure in sending our team to India, next step depends on ICC's response: BCB presidentIndia provided asylum for deposed Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina while the funeral of another Prime Minister, Khaleda Zia, was attended by the external affairs minister. The troll seems to have missed these events.In a fixThe BCCI’s action — it is an arm of the ruling party after all — has put Indian sport in a fix. This is the country that hopes to host the 2036 Olympics. By then how many countries might upset the authorities and how loud will the calls be for banning these for perceived slights? Shah Rukh Khan will be 70 then.This is not to say that sport and politics do not mix. That would be naive. Boycotts on moral grounds (apartheid in South Africa) have shown that when nations stand together, change can happen.Bangladesh bans IPL telecast, cites ‘hurt sentiments’But this Bangladesh issue has not been thought through at a time when India are trying to mend fences with their neighbours. Depending on which side of the political divide you are, this is either a victory for India’s foreign policy, or yet another neighbourhood disaster.Not for the first time, cricket has to bear the burden of political posturing. This means either that sport is not important, and therefore can be a substitute for low-grade politics, or it is so important that only cricket can carry the intended message, whatever that is. But sport does not reshape the world, it merely reflects it.And what it is reflecting now is not pretty. The weaponisation of sport or entertainment or justice or religion or any sphere of human activity never is. Bullying is usually a sign of insecurity.When things go wrong, cricket is blamed for failing where it was never equipped to succeed. It is forced to wear the cloak of failure that politicians shed with alacrity. Cricket has carried more weight than it asked for because it can be a shared language.Bangladesh ‘not to travel’ to India for T20 World CupThe ICC, an arm of the BCCI and by extension the Indian government, is probably awaiting instructions. In the past, it was India who championed the entry of their neighbours Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh into international cricket. For long Afghanistan used India as ‘home’ ground because of the situation there. We can call none of these countries our friends now. Cricket diplomacy cuts both ways — it strengthens ties (its expected role) as easily as it divides nations when handled negatively.The whole affair exposes the dangers of politicians running sports. And of foreign policy based on social media posts. When the ‘might is right’ approach — Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair! — is the prevailing orthodoxy, it will take time to appreciate that actually doing right constitutes might. That strength flows from fairness.Published- January 07, 2026 12:29 am ISTRead  Comments0/0NewCopy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditREAD LATERSEE ALLRemovePRINTRelated TopicsBetween Wickets/cricket/Bangladesh/sports organisations",0.008144454751597608,Neutral

And on that note, let’s begin with some good news: in line with the growing use of AI in medicine, the Health Ministry has said that an AI-powered tool, theClinical Decision Support System is set to be deployed at various public and private hospitals. The tool will provide free digital assistance to doctors for faster, evidence-based decision-making, reportsBindu Shajan Perappadan. In a country where serpentine queues at government hospitals entail hours of waiting time, this may spell better outcomes for the future, albeit, if appropriate safeguards are in place, as with all things AI.Another move that may be of good news for public health but has raised protests in some quarters is the Finance Ministry’s notification ofnew GST rates for tobacco products. Bidis have been moved to the 18% category from the now-defunct 28% slab. All other tobacco products have been moved to the 40% slab. These new rates will be effective from February 1, 2026, writesT.C.A. Sharad Raghavan. The government has stated that this is in line with global public health guidance. There is no doubt that tobacco is a major risk factor for non-communicable diseases, the burden of which India is reeling under.AdvertisementPowered by:00:0000:00Ad will close in:3 seconds orclick to closeHowever, the Federation of All India Farmer Associations has said this move will hurt farmers’ income and exacerbate smuggling in a market already grappling with illicit trade -- highlighting the need for reforms that take into account impacts on livelihoods while trying to safeguard public health. In related news and just in case a reminder was needed as to just how bad tobacco is for the body, do readDr. Shilpa Ellur’s article onhow tobacco wreaks havoc on men’s fertility.While there is always a little lift that good news in the health sector provides, 2025 did not end all that well, and the ramifications are continuing into the new year: theIndore water contamination deaths and illnesseshave once again brought to the fore the fact that clean air and clean water continue to remain out of reach for millions in India. Do readMehul Malpani’scoverageas well asour editorial on this subject. With an officialdeath toll of seven(though residents allege there are more), and 110 in hospital, this is a tragedy that is continuing to unfold and calls for a serious re-look at not just urban water and sanitation systems, but also at our water as a whole: what are we doing to keep it clean, what checks and balances there are in place, and why we cannot enforce clean water regulations.One quick update from international news: the United States hasnow ended its longstanding guidance that all children receive vaccines against ​flu and three other diseases,a sweeping change that is next in a line of several such changes that have taken place of late. Public health experts in the country have warned that this latest rollback could lead to preventable hospitalisations and deaths.On the Indian news front, two developments need highlighting. The first, is a TB report titled‘India’s Progress in Addressing the Challenges of Tuberculosis’, that has identified India’s rural, tribal and migrant communities as those faced with multiple challenges when fighting tuberculosis. With India battling to eliminate TB, the report is a reminder of where challenges lie, both for patients and frontline workers. The second development is theHealth Ministry’s ban on oral formulation of nimesulide above 100mg in immediate release form,citing serious risks to health. Nimesulide is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug used for its pain-relieving, anti-inflammatory, and fever-reducing effects.Moving on to research on health that has made headlines this week: mental health has taken centre-stage. In worrying but not surprising news,the Indian Psychiatric Society has expressed deep concern over the persistently high mental health treatment gap in India, noting that nearly 80-85% of individuals suffering from psychiatric disorders do not receive timely or appropriate care.The burden in India is huge; access to care remains dismal and this is a gap that urgently needs closing. Research continues to bear out the importance of this: older adults who are frail and have depression could be at a higher risk of dementia, with the factors combinedcontributing to 17 per cent of the overall risk, according to a study from China; while another study from Saudi Arabia found thatinsomnia or anxiety could be linked to fewer number of immune cells, potentially resulting in a less effective immune system.Athira Elssa Johnson, meanwhile, breaks down astudy that reveals many mental health conditions share common genetic risksrather than having distinct biological origins, meaning that individuals who carry a genetic risk for one mental health condition may also be biologically vulnerable to other conditions within the same genetic group -- underscoring the need for holistic mental and physical health care.For our tailpiece this week, we haveMeenakshy S.’s on the judgement, prejudice, misunderstandings thattrans men face when they access healthcare.

Governor Channa Reddy’s convoy and CM Jayalalithaa sought his recallPremium",National,2026-01-07,"Around 3 pm on April 10, 1995, Tamil Nadu Governor M. Channa Reddy had left the Raj Bhavan (now Lok Bhavan) for Pondicherry (now, Puducherry). When his convoy reached Tindivanam, a group of ruling AIADMK men hurled eggs and stones at it. The men were led by S.S. Panneerselvam, the party secretary for Villupuram Ramasamy Padayachiar district unit (present day Villupuram). They were angry that Reddy was entertaining the then Janata Party leader Subramanian Swamy, who had sought to prosecute Chief Minister Jayalalithaa (then spelt Jayalalitha) on corruption charges.The Governor’s convoy was held up at Tindivanam-Pondicherry junction for over 15 minutes. Reddy called the District Superintendent of Police (SP), Vijayakumar, who was at the spot, and directed him to clear the road.The HinduCuddalore Correspondent reported that Mr Vijayakumar said the demonstrators threw stones and eggs, “which, however, missed the vehicles in the Governor’s convoy.”The incident occurred when hostilities between Jayalalithaa and Reddy were common knowledge.AdvertisementPowered by:00:0100:00Ad will close in:3 seconds orclick to closeThe infamous standoff between CM, Governor in T.N.Report to CentreThe Governor promptly sent a report to the Centre attributing the hold up of his convoy to “alleged intervention of higher-ups at Madras (State capital)”. He concluded his report thus: “It is more than obvious that the demonstrations are being organised with the police help which is a sad commentary on and suggestive of the methods of the ruling party.”When opposition parties criticised the attack on the Governor’s convoy, Revenue Minister S.D. Somasundaram claimed the AIADMK men had only assembled in a democratic manner to stage a demonstration against Reddy’s “encouragement” to Mr. Swamy to create trouble in the State.Plea for recallEndorsing this narrative, Jayalalithaa wrote to President Shankar Dayal Sharma and Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao urging them to recall the Governor. Accusing Reddy of acting with a “pre-meditated bias” she asked the Centre not to take seriously his “continued misreporting of events in the State.”NEET Bill: T.N.’s executive order route has parallels in 1990sDisclosing the contents of her letters in the Legislative Assembly on April 19 that year, Jayalalithaa said the Governor’s “open espousal” of Mr. Swamy’s cause had further infused tension in the already vitiated atmosphere of Tamil Nadu following the sanction accorded by Reddy for prosecuting her.According to her, the Governor’s own “unconscionable, unconstitutional actions” had rendered his position in the State totally untenable. ‘Denying Reddy’s charges, she said, “They can only be viewed as a sinister, pre-mediated design to project a picture of chaos and breakdown of law and public order in Tamil Nadu as to enable him to make an eventual report for action against the State government under Article 356 of the Constitution.”Jayalalithaa insisted all bandobust arrangements were in place along the Governor’s route on April 10 on the basis of intelligence reports. The district SP, along with a posse of police, had gone to Tindivanam to supervise the arrangements following reports that “about 1,500 AIADMK volunteers and general public” had assembled near the Government Guest House “to demonstrate with the intention of pointing out that certain acts of the Governor had injured democracy.”Related StoriesThe DMK’s gubernatorial testWhen Governors moved against Chief Ministers in the recent pastAs per her account, long before the Governor’s convoy reached the place, the crowd had been dispersed after a mild lathi charge by the police resulting in minor injuries to four persons. However, when the advance pilot car of the convoy came to the place around 4.25 p.m. about 300 persons rushed out from the nearby bus stand and took their position on one side of the road. But, this crowd also was dispersed and pushed to the roadside opposite to Veeranam guest house.“Though the way was clear for the Governor’s convoy, Dr. Channa Reddy summoned the Superintendent of Police and told him that he could continue his journey only after the crowd on the roadside was fully dispersed. The police officer complied and made way for the Governor after lathi charging the crowd in which seven police personnel and 11 demonstrators were injured. The Governor then proceeded to Pondicherry. The situation was tactfully handled without any untoward incident. This was the fact,” she said. [The Hindu,April 20, 1995]Letter to Chief SecretaryHowever, the Governor had written to the Chief Secretary claiming the SP had developed cold feet to handle the situation.“The Director General of Police, in his report to the government, had refuted this. It was also not correct to say that fax messages were sent from the Governor’s side to several officers even before his departure to Madras. The Chief Secretary who was in the officers’ gallery in the legislature could have been easily reached. It was not clear why this was not done,” Jayalalithaa told the Assembly.In Tamil Nadu, a spat with a differenceIn her letter to the President and Prime Minister, she said allegations of police apathy, bureaucratic stupor and police-sponsored demonstrations made by the Governor “are contradictions in terms and have to be dismissed as petulant ramblings born out of pique.” She added, “The subjective satisfaction of an individual should also be subject to satisfying the requirements of truth.” The Governor’s “subjective conclusions,” according to her, “are partisan expressions made with the calculated and diabolical design of creating a record to eventually recommend the dismissal of the State Government.”Jayalalithaa said the government had earlier maintained silence on the incident since it did not want to blow up a non-issue but she was constrained to reveal everything in the House.Following a regime change in 1996, a case was booked against Mr. Panneerselvam and others and prosecution was initiated.Published- January 07, 2026 05:30 am ISTRead  Comments0/0NewCopy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditREAD LATERSEE ALLRemovePRINTRelated TopicsTamil Nadu/state politics/Jayalalithaa/Governor",0.011636432350718066,Neutral

Later, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. was not seeking to “govern” Venezuela but would enforce changes through economic sanctions and a naval quarantine, which is currently in place on oil tankers going in and coming out of Venezuela.AdvertisementPowered by:00:1200:00Ad will close in:3 seconds orclick to closeU.S. naval moves against Venezuela | ExplainedIn Tuesday’s post, Mr. Trump said the oil sent by Venezuela would be sold at the market price and the proceeds would be controlled by him “to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States”. But he did not say what would Venezuela would get in return or provide a timeline for shipping the oil.“I have asked Energy Secretary Chris Wright to execute this plan, immediately. It will be taken by storage ships, and brought directly to unloading docks in the United States,” he added.Venezuela, which has the world’s largest proven oil reserves, currently produces less than one million barrels of oil a day. At the current production levels, it would take more than two months for Venezuela to produce 50 million barrels of oil. At the current price — around $60 per barrel Brent crude — 50 million barrels of oil would be worth roughly $3 billion.The Venezuelan government, now headed by interim leader Delcy Rodriguez, the former Vice President, has not immediately responded to Mr. Trump’s claim.Ms. Rodriguez, who along with her brother Jorge Rodriguez (who is now the President of the National Assembly of Venezuela), made up the inner circle of Mr. Maduro’s government, had earlier said Mr. Maduro was the only legitimate President of the country. Mr. Maduro is currently in U.S. captivity, facing charges of “narco-terrorism”.On January 5, after she was appointed the interim leader by Venezuela’s top court, Ms. Rodriguez issued a statement, reaffirming Venezuela’s “commitment to peaceful coexistence”.“We invite the U.S. government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation oriented towards shared development within the framework of international law to strengthen lasting community coexistence,” she said, signalling cooperation with Washington.Mr. Trump had threatened Ms. Rodriguez on January 4, saying, “If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.”Mr. Trump had claimed even before the American attack that Venezuela had stolen American oil resources and demanded Caracas to “return” them. Vice President J.D. Vance echoed this claim after Mr. Maduro was captured, writing in a social media post. “Venezuela expropriated American oil property and until recently used that stolen property to get rich and fund their narcoterrorist activities”.Venezuela nationalised its oil sector in 1976. Former President Hugo Chavez tightened the state control of the energy sector after he came to power in 1999. Today, only one American company, Chevron, operates in Venezuela. Mr. Trump is expected to meet top executives from three oil companies, Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil at the White House to discuss potential investments in Venezuela.Published- January 07, 2026 06:02 am ISTRead  Comments0/0NewCopy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditREAD LATERSEE ALLRemovePRINTRelated TopicsWorld/USA/Donald Trump/U.S. action on Venezuela/Venezuela",0.06272052154195011,Positive

https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dangerous-paradigm-on-trump-venezuela-and-unhinged-depredation/article70478068.ece,"​Dangerous paradigm: On Trump, Venezuela and unhinged depredation",General,2026-01-06,"Following thekidnapping and removal to U.S. soil of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, on the back of military action not authorised by Congress or supported by the UN, U.S. President Donald Trump has now made clear his intent to set the crosshairs of American neo-imperialist expansionism on other nations and territories including Colombia, Greenland, Mexico, Cuba, and Iran. The Trump administration surprised the world, and apparently Venezuelan military forces, when it launched an overnight strike on Caracas over the weekend, including likely use of artillery and special forces, to extract the Maduros to face federal drug trafficking and weapons charges – charges thatMr. Maduro pleaded not guiltyto. Responding to media after the event, Mr. Trump appeared to be setting his sights on Colombian President Gustavo Petro, whenhe saidthat that country was being “run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the U.S.,” and “He’s not going to be doing it for very long.” Similarly, Mr. Trump has remarked that the U.S. has a “need” for Greenland from the perspective of its “national security”, that “something will have to be done about Mexico” to rid the nation of the scourge of drug cartels, that Cuba is “ready to fall” in the absence of revenue linked to Venezuelan oil, and that Iran would be “hit very hard by the U.S.” if it cracked down on protesters on its soil.While the Trump administration has consistently lowered the threshold of norms and acceptable standards for the conduct of nations on the global stage and diverged from the positions of previous Democrat- and Republican-led governments on the threat posed, for example by Russia to Europe, to directly engage in unauthorised and illegal interference of a brazen kind and seek regime change through the use of force in an established hemispheric power is a new low. The deeper danger of this so called “Donroe Doctrine” — ultimately premised on seizing Venezuela’s cherished oil resources rather than any pretext of “restoring democracy” — is that it may embolden autocrats and nations with an appetite for fomenting conflict to engage in similar destabilising unilateral military action against perceived enemies, potentially resulting in full-fledged cross-border confrontations. Today’s Venezuela was yesterday’s Ukraine and might be tomorrow’s Taiwan, if Mr. Trump’s paradigm for settling scores propagates further. While the leaders of each potential future target of U.S. aggression and the UN leadership have protested such action by Washington, it might take nothing less than the major powers of today, including India, Europe, Australia, Africa and Latin America, speaking in one voice against this unhinged depredation by the Trump administration to halt this dangerous new paradigm in its tracks.Published- January 07, 2026 12:20 am ISTRead  Comments0/0NewCopy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditREAD LATERSEE ALLRemovePRINTRelated TopicsUSA/U.S. action on Venezuela/arrest/armed conflict/Colombia/Greenland/Mexico/Cuba/Iran/narcotics & drug trafficking/oil and gas - upstream activities/political parties/government/democracy/Ukraine/Taiwan/India/Europe/Australia/Africa",-0.032222522847522854,Neutral

While the government has promised to address the economic grievances of the traders, it has also warned of a harsh response to “rioters”. At least 12 people have been killed in the past week with the protests spreading. This renewed cycle of unrest comes amid the deepening economic vulnerabilities and political risks confronting Iran’s theocratic state, just six months after it survived a fierce 12-day war with Israel. What makes the protests challenging for Iran’s rulers is the perceived involvement of foreign powers. Mossad, Israel’s spy agency, claimed, on December 29, that its operatives were present “in the field” with the protesters. On January 2, U.S. President Donald Trump, who had ordered strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities during theJune 2025 war between Iran and Israel, threatened Iran that theU.S. was “locked and loaded”to use force if protesters were killed.The Islamic Republic is facing immense economic strain. In October, food inflation hit 64%, the second highest after South Sudan. The rial has lost 60% of its value since the June war, while oil exports in 2025 fell by about 7% from its 2024 average. Power outages have become a daily reality. The severity of the crisis was underscored in December when President Masoud Pezeshkian said his government was “stuck” and could not perform “miracles” to fix the problems. As the economy deteriorates and external threats mount, the regime’s greater repression is creating a cycle of crisis. Mr. Pezeshkian has relaxed the grip of the morality police on public life. But when it comes to the economy or national security, his hands are tied. Washington’s policy of economic squeeze and threats is deepening the suffering of ordinary Iranians while turning the regime more paranoid. If the U.S. genuinely seeks to resolve the Iran problem, it should engage with and empower Mr. Pezeshkian, rather than threatening Tehran on Israel’s behalf. Iran’s rulers should also be open for reforms. The regime’s default response to any crisis has been to blame external forces, but it ignores a more fundamental reality. Years of shrinking economic opportunity and the erosion of political and personal freedoms have created a reservoir of public anger that could erupt. Religion and nationalism may no longer suffice in the face of an economic crisis. Iran’s leadership must initiate reforms, tackle corruption and re-engage with the world.Published- January 07, 2026 12:10 am ISTRead  Comments0/0NewCopy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditREAD LATERSEE ALLRemovePRINTRelated TopicsIran/currency values/unrest, conflicts and  war/Israel/economy (general)/USA/inflation and deflation/food/oil and gas - upstream activities/exports",0.03464285714285714,Neutral
https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/indias-academic-openness-under-strain/article70478537.ece,India’s academic openness under strainPremium,General,2026-01-06,"The recentdenial of entry to noted Hindi scholar Francesca Orsinifrom the U.K., despite holding a valid visa, has brought to light the need for a more balanced and thoughtful approach to understanding and assessing the role of critical academic engagement, and to recognising the broader value of scholarly exchange both within and beyond India.It seems that a rather difficult situation is emerging for international scholars who have critically engaged with Indian society, politics, or history. Entering on a tourist visa and participating in academic events can expose them to procedural complications related to visa regulations, while applying for an academic visa may itself become challenging in light of their critical scholarly work. This places such scholars in a constrained position, limiting opportunities for academic exchange and dialogue.Francesca Orsini: Scholar of the eastThe long-term consequence of this paradox is clear: independent and critical voices from abroad will gradually be silenced, rendered rare, and eventually made invisible in India’s academic landscape. This situation raises a fundamental question about the spirit of inclusiveness in Indian academia. Universities and research institutions have historically thrived on exchange, critique, and intellectual diversity. The presence of global scholars — sometimes sharply critical, sometimes sympathetic — has enriched debates, introduced new frameworks, and helped Indian academics situate their work in global conversations.AdvertisementPowered by:00:0000:00Ad will close in:3 seconds orclick to closeSign of vitalityIn a democracy, criticism is not a threat; it is a sign of vitality. From anthropologists studying caste to historians revisiting colonial legacies and economists questioning policy orthodoxy, these critical engagements in Indian academia have helped refine national self-understanding. India’s reputation as a vibrant democracy has never been undermined by such scholarship. On the contrary, it has been strengthened by the openness with which these voices were received and debated. It is important to recall that no government in India has ever fallen because of academic criticism. Universities and research programmes across the country have long demonstrated maturity in accommodating a spectrum of ideas, including those critical of state policies. Research funding agencies such as the UGC, ICSSR, ICHR, and DST have historically supported projects examining sensitive social and political questions without censorship or hostility.Intellectual lossThe danger today is not only administrative. When international scholars with a critical perspective grow hesitant to apply for visas, when Indian researchers hesitate to engage with interrogative frameworks, and when conferences avoid certain topics to ensure permissions, academic life itself becomes impoverished. The loss is not merely institutional but intellectual and moral. Nations that have prized only conformity have rarely advanced in the long run, either in knowledge or in innovation. India, which has always projected itself as a civilisation rooted in dialogue, samvad, must not turn its back on this tradition.Editorial |Free world: On the deportation of Francesca OrsiniFurthermore, academic collaboration today operates in a deeply interconnected global environment. Research in areas such as digital culture, climate change, migration, artificial intelligence, and postcolonial theory cannot be meaningfully pursued in isolation. When certain scholars are denied access, entire research networks fragment. Students lose opportunities to interact with international peers; projects lose comparative depth; and the overall quality of scholarship declines. The effect is cumulative, slow but lasting. Inclusiveness in academia, hence, is not simply a matter of hospitality but of democratic responsibility. A confident democracy has nothing to fear from critique; in fact, it thrives on it. The most effective way to counter misunderstanding or misrepresentation is through open dialogue, not exclusion.The history of Indian scholarship offers numerous examples of such engagement. The work of sociologists, historians, and anthropologists, both Indian and foreign, has shaped global understanding of caste, gender, religion, and modernity. These studies have sometimes been uncomfortable for those in power but have helped India appear as an intellectually vibrant society fearless of bureaucratic scrutiny. This pluralism is a hallmark of democracy, and it has always coexisted with patriotic commitment.Risk of echo chambersIf it begins to appear that India is using visa restrictions as a means of selective control over academic engagement, the message sent to the world will be unfortunate: that India no longer welcomes the exchange of ideas unless they conform to official narratives. Over time, the space for independent thought would shrink, and universities would risk becoming echo chambers. What India needs instead is a renewed commitment to academic openness, a framework that differentiates between political subversion and intellectual dissent, that trusts scholars to engage in debate without ulterior motives, and that recognises the long-term benefits of a plural academic environment.It is not that there are no initiatives to promote international academic collaboration; the Global Initiative of Academic Networks (GIAN) is a notable example of such efforts. However, for initiatives like GIAN to be truly meaningful, they must also create space for critical scholars to engage freely and thoughtfully with Indian academia, enriching dialogue through diverse and independent perspectives. To build a future-oriented, knowledge-driven society, India must invite all serious thinkers to participate in its academic life, irrespective of their critical positions.An inclusive and confident academic culture is the best reflection of a mature democracy, one that listens, argues, and learns.T.

Jagan Mohan Reddy’s ruleChief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu had envisioned Amaravati as a greenfield capital city and began giving shape to the idea in early 2014.To rule out the possibility of any future attempt to shift the capital, the TDP-led government sought to move a Bill in Parliament to give Amaravati legal sanctity, leveraging its position as a constituent of the NDA.AdvertisementPowered by:00:0100:00Ad will close in:3 seconds orclick to closeAccording to a TDP MP, this effort has been part of a continuous process. The Bill was expected to be tabled during the recently concluded Winter Session of Parliament, but that did not materialise.Related StoriesCRDA clears ₹2,015 crore worth projects for AmaravatiIconic Integrated Amaravati Government Complex with five towers to come up in 32 acresTightrope walk for AmaravatiAmaravati: From ghost city to model cityAmaravati: The promised landCapital project: The making of AmaravatiAmaravati: From mythology to realityAmaravati: A financial and business hubThe project moved at a reasonable pace until early 2019, when Mr. Jagan proposed the idea of three capital cities, effectively stalling Amaravati’s progress.The YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) government put the brakes on the project in the name of decentralisation, triggering a prolonged legal battle that eventually ended in favour of farmers in March 2022.The YSRCP government had challenged the Andhra Pradesh High Court verdict in the Supreme Court by filing a Special Leave Petition.A few months after returning to power in June 2024, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP)-led coalition government filed an affidavit in the High Court, committing itself to completing the ambitious project within three years. However, given the YSRCP’s track record of reversing several decisions taken by the previous TDP government during 2014-19, there is a lingering fear that if Mr. Jagan were to stage a political comeback in 2029, he might revive the plan to split the capital into three — developing Visakhapatnam and Kurnool as the executive and judicial capitals respectively, while leaving only the State Legislature in Amaravati.It may be recalled that the YSRCP government had earlier challenged the allotment of land to certain individuals and companies in Amaravati, alleging “insider trading”.Mr. Jagan continues to be critical of large-scale investments in Amaravati, arguing that such spending would be detrimental to the north coastal districts and the drought-prone Rayalaseema region.The current coalition government, meanwhile, suspects that Mr. Jagan and his party are backing a section of farmers who are allegedly creating obstacles to the project.This prompted Mr. Naidu and the A.P. governmentto push for a Billin Parliament to grant Amaravati formal legal status as the capital.The proposed legislation seeks to secure formal recognition from the Central government by amending the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 (APRA), under which Hyderabad was designated the common capital of both Telugu States — Telangana and Andhra Pradesh — for a period of 10 years.The objective of the proposed law is to place Amaravati under the protection of a Central statute, thereby preventing successive State governments from tampering with capital-related decisions.A senior advocate who represented farmers from the region in the High Court observed that the YSRCP’s “trifurcation decision” resulted in substantial financial loss to the public exchequer and was taken not on administrative grounds but for vindictive and mala fide reasons.What delayed the tabling of the Bill in Parliament was reportedly a conundrum over whether Amaravati should be declared the capital from the date the APRA came into force or from the present date. However, this is seen as a hurdle that can eventually be overcome.In this context, it is argued that the Central government is empowered to decide the capital of the residuary State of Andhra Pradesh, having exercised similar authority in prescribing a common capital under the APRA.Amaravati was declared and notified as the capital of Andhra Pradesh by the Centre on December 31, 2014, a move subsequently followed by the Survey of India. The coalition government has therefore felt the need to amend Section 5(2) of the APRA to legally fortify Amaravati’s position as the State capital.There is little doubt about the government’s resolve not to leave anything to chance. It is now only a matter of time before the necessary legal safeguards are put in place.Published- January 07, 2026 12:35 am ISTRead  Comments0Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditREAD LATERSEE ALLRemovePRINTRelated TopicsAndhra Pradesh/state politics",0.03899044011544012,Neutral
